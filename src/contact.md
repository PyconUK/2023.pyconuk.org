## PyCon UK artwork

PyCon UK is very grateful for the original and characteristic graphic art produced for us -- as it has been for several years -- by [The Developer Society](https://www.dev.ngo). This includes our website, our logos and designs, and the instantly-recognisable Pythons that grace them.
