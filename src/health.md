<p>At PyCon UK, our priority is to hold a safe event.</p>

<p>We expect attendees to be mindful of health and considerate to others during the event. This includes having up-to-date vaccinations, taking a self-administered test in case of symptoms, observing all reasonable precautions, and not attending if feeling unwell. </p>

<p>We will offer full refunds to attendees who are unable to attend the conference.</p>

<p>There are currently no legal requirements to wear face-masks at events such conferences in England or Wales, you may wish to consider wearing, and you may be asked to wear a face covering in other places.</p>

<p>Please be respectful of other peopleâ€™s choices, whether they choose to wear a face covering or not.</p>

<p>Free face masks will be available at the registration desk if you need one (but please still bring your own).</p>

<p>We will monitor any changes in public health guidance and review these guidelines on a regular basis.</p>
