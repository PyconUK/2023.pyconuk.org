**Sponsoring PyCon UK is a great way for your company to support the Python community, promote your products to more than seven hundred delegates, and meet Python developers who are looking for work.**

We couldn't run the conference without the generous support of our sponsors.

In return, we will ensure that your company is given exposure before, during, and after the conference, and we will work with you so that you get exactly what you're looking for out of sponsoring the conference.

If you are interested in sponsoring the conference, please [contact us](/contact/).
We will publish details of our sponsorship packages soon.
